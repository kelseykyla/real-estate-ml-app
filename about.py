            **PriceScope** is a **proptech startup** dedicated to transforming how property 
            decisions are made in the **Kenyan housing market**.  

            House hunting is often time-consuming, stressful, and expensive — buyers and renters 
            are forced to move from one neighborhood to another in search of the right property.  
            PriceScope reduces this burden by providing **data-driven property valuations** and 
            **real-time insights** that bring clarity and transparency to the process.  

            **✨ Key Offerings:**
            - 🏠 **Predictive Pricing Models** powered by Random Forest, Decision Trees & SVM  
            - 📊 **Comprehensive Valuation Reports** with current and projected property values  
            - 🔄 **What-If Scenario Analysis** to forecast impacts of neighborhood or economic changes  
            - 🌍 **User-Friendly Web App** built with Streamlit for easy accessibility
